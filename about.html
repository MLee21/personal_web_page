          <h3>About</h3>
          <p> Hi, I'm Minnie Lee! I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but I grew up in Denver, and I love it! <br> This site was created to give you a taste of Denver and its rich culture through my eyes. <br> I am a heavy advocate of women doing what they love and being empowered by their passions.<br> I would like to expound upon the introduction of Asians into media with shows like "Fresh Off the Boat" <br> and Youtube famous makeup artists, but mostly, I just want to give back to my community. <br> I am classically trained on the piano, read like a fiend, take hip hop dance,<br> and I am currently learning how to program. <br> I am heavily involved in the Denver music scene <br> and was interning at Dryer Plug Studios.<br> So, while you're listening to the featured local band after your wonderful session at the Block 1750, <br> and receiving your daily dose of inspiration from the daily quotes, take in Denver! <br> It's a pretty rad place. Cheers!
